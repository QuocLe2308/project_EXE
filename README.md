-   `Client/`: Contains the entire Next.js frontend application.
-   `ProjectEXE/`: Contains the Spring Boot backend application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   JDK 17 or later
-   Maven
-   Node.js and npm
-   MySQL Server

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```sh
    cd ProjectEXE/ProjectEXE
    ```
2.  Configure the database connection:
    -   Open `src/main/resources/application.yml`.
    -   Update the `spring.datasource.url`, `username`, and `password` to match your local MySQL setup.
    -   Configure your JWT secret key and other sensitive properties.
3.  Install dependencies and run the application:
    ```sh
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup (Next.js)

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```sh
    cd Client
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  If needed, create a `.env.local` file to specify the backend API URL:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
    ```
4.  Run the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
